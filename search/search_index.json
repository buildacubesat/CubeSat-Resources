The basic \u201c1U\u201d CubeSat is a 10\u00d710\u00d710 cm cube. These standardized form factors use common deployer hardware, which lowers the cost of development and launch, making access to space more attainable \u2013 even for small teams or individuals. It\u2019s important to note that launch provider capabilities and requirements may deviate from the CDS and will ultimately determine the allowable volume and weight of the satellite.</p> <p>This section is for those new to CubeSats or small satellite development.

Most likely, the process will not be linear, and different aspects of your system will be in different stages.</p> <p>If your CubeSat mission is result-oriented, you probably have a payload that needs to reach orbit and send data back. In that case, it's advisable to source a bus with flight heritage \u2013 i.e. structure and subsystems that have been flight-proven \u2013 from an established vendor. Check out SatSearch, SatCatalog and CubeSat Shop for help with sourcing.</p> <p>If your mission is process-oriented, you\u2019re more likely to build a large portion of the flight segment yourself. This is absolutely feasible, but the process tends to be more iterative and may involve more work in integration, qualification, and testing. It\u2019s common to build a FlatSat or engineering model first \u2013 a functional layout of all your subsystems on a testbench \u2013 for easier debugging and early verification.</p> <p>Most academic missions take a hybrid approach: Source some of the parts (usually, the structure and EPS) and build others in-house.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#launch-provider-procurement","title":"Launch Provider Procurement","text":"<p>Starting the process of finding a rideshare opportunity early will help you align with your launch provider\u2019s requirements, avoid costly redesigns, and fully leverage their support offerings.

TT&amp;C is a commonly used abbreviation:</p> <p>A special case is the beacon: a low-data-rate, always-on (during commissioning) signal that periodically transmits basic telemetry (e.g. battery voltage, temperature, timestamp, ID). Beacons help confirm the satellite is alive and can be used to aid tracking. The SatNOGS network has become a de facto standard for receiving and sharing beacon data in open-source and academic missions, enabling global signal tracking and community-supported downlink coverage.</p> <p>CubeSat beacons are most commonly found in the UHF amateur band (~437\u202fMHz) and typically use simple modulation schemes like AFSK, BPSK, or GMSK. They often conform to protocols such as AX.25 for compatibility with amateur ground stations.</p> <p>Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&amp;C) refers to the fundamental communication link between a spacecraft and its ground segment. </p> <ul> <li>Telemetry: Downlinked data about the spacecraft\u2019s health, status, and environment (e.g. temperature, voltage, position).</li> <li>Tracking: Ground-based tracking of the satellite\u2019s orbit and signal, often using Doppler shift and time-of-flight data.</li> <li>Command: Uplinked instructions that control the satellite\u2019s behavior, such as mode changes, resets, or payload activation.</li> </ul> <p>TT&amp;C is typically implemented on a robust, low-data-rate RF link\u2014often in UHF or VHF\u2014to ensure reliability even under degraded conditions.
