# Payload

The payload is the purpose of the mission — whether it's a sensor, imager, experiment, or technology demo. This section covers payload subsystems, with a focus on single-board computers (SBCs) often used for data collection and processing. It also includes topics like mechanical mounting, electrical interfacing, and resource constraints such as power and data throughput.
