# Assembly, Intergation and Testing

Assembly, Integration, and Testing (AIT) covers the practical side of putting a CubeSat together and making sure it works as expected. This includes mechanical assembly, electrical integration, functional checks, and environmental testing like vibration and thermal cycling. A solid AIT process is critical for mission success, even in early-stage or educational projects.
