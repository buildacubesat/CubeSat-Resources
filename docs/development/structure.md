# Structure

The structure forms the mechanical backbone of a CubeSat, supporting all subsystems and ensuring compatibility with deployers. This section covers standard CubeSat frames, custom designs, materials, fasteners, mounting strategies, and mechanical interfaces. It also includes deployable elements such as antennas, booms, and solar panels, along with the mechanisms and constraints involved in their reliable release. Structural analysis, tolerancing, and environmental resilience (e.g. vibration and thermal effects) are also addressed.
