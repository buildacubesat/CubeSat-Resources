# Attitude Determination and Control Systems

Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS) manage a CubeSat's orientation in space — whether it needs to point an antenna, aim a camera, or passively stabilize. This section covers passive methods (like gravity gradient booms and magnetic hysteresis), active control components (magnetorquers, reaction wheels), and sensors for determining orientation (sun sensors, magnetometers, star trackers, and gyros).
