# Qualification and Launch

This section covers the final steps before flight: environmental testing, documentation, regulatory approvals, and launch procurement. Topics include vibration and thermal testing, interface requirements for deployers, licensing (frequency and export control), and how to secure a launch slot through brokers or rideshare programs.

## Environmental Testing

To be added here:

- Vibration, thermal, and vacuum testing
- Common standards (e.g. NASA GEVS, ECSS)
- Access to testing facilities vs. DIY methods

## Documentation & Interfaces

To be added here:

- Interface Control Documents (ICDs)
- Mass properties and deployment specs
- Integration checklists and templates

## Launch Procurement

To be added here:

- Launch brokers and rideshare providers
- Mission planning timelines and constraints
- Costs and typical contract structures

## Insurance

To be added here:

- Pre-launch and launch-phase insurance options
- What is typically covered (damage, loss, delay)
- Risk analysis and whether it's worth it for CubeSats

## Regulatory Requirements

To be added here:

- Frequency licensing (ITU, IARU, national bodies)
- Export control (e.g. EAR, ITAR)
- Space debris mitigation and other filings

## Launch Integration

To be added here:

- Deployers (e.g. P-POD, Exopod, ISIPOD)
- Mechanical fit checks and fastener compliance
- Final inspection and handover process
