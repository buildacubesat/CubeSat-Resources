# Thermal Management

Thermal management is a critical aspect of CubeSat design. This section looks at how to model, monitor, and control temperatures in orbit, including passive methods (like coatings and conduction paths) and active systems (like heaters or thermal straps). It also covers testing and simulation tools for predicting thermal behavior across mission phases.
