# Tools and Helpers

This section collects practical tools that support CubeSat development and assembly. It includes physical tools (like crimpers, torque drivers, microscopes), custom jigs and fixtures for alignment or testing, as well as helpful software tools (ECAD, CAD, code, simulation, visualization) and calculators. Whether you're wiring harnesses, assembling PCBs, or measuring fastener torque, this is where the hands-on helpers live.
