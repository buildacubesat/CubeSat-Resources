# Overview

This section covers the technical aspects of CubeSat development, including subsystem design, integration, testing, and operations. Use the menu to explore specific topics like power, avionics, communications, and ground support.

[**Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS)**](adcs.md)  
Orientation sensing and control using magnetorquers, reaction wheels, star trackers, and inertial sensors.

[**Assembly, Integration and Testing (AIT)**](ait.md)  
Mechanical assembly, electrical integration, simulation, functional testing, and environmental qualification.

[**Communications**](comms.md)  
Radio systems for telemetry, tracking, command, and payload downlink across UHF to X-band.

[**Electrical Power Systems (EPS)**](eps.md)  
Power generation, storage, regulation, distribution, and protection for all spacecraft subsystems.

[**Flight Software**](flight-software.md)  
Onboard software for data handling, control loops, scheduling, fault detection, and autonomy.

[**Ground Segment**](ground-segment.md)  
Ground stations, radios, tracking systems, and software for commanding and telemetry reception.

[**Inhibits and Hold Down & Release Mechanisms (HDRM)**](inhibits-hdrm.md)  
Launch safety mechanisms including inhibits, deployment switches, timers, and hold-down and release systems.

[**Qualification and Launch**](launch.md)  
Environmental testing, documentation, licensing, and securing a launch opportunity.

[**Onboard Computing (OBC)**](obc.md)  
MCUs, FPGAs, and SBCs used to control the spacecraft and interface with all subsystems.

[**Payload**](payload.md)  
Mission instruments and experimental hardware for sensing, data collection, and technology demonstration.

[**Structure**](structure.md)  
Frames, fasteners, deployables, and mechanical design for structural integrity and deployer compatibility.

[**Thermal Management**](thermal.md)  
Passive and active strategies for keeping components within safe operating temperatures.

[**Tools and Helpers**](tools.md)  
Practical tools, jigs, fixtures, scripts, and utilities used during development and assembly.
