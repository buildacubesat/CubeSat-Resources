ðŸ”¹ Uplink / Downlink (Telemetry, Commands, Data)
Amateur Bands
Used by university/research CubeSats under IARU coordination

UHF

Uplink: 435â€“438â€¯MHz

Downlink: 437â€¯MHz range (very common)

VHF

Uplink: 145.9â€“146.0â€¯MHz

Downlink: 144.0â€“146.0â€¯MHz

L-band

Occasionally used (e.g. 1.2â€“1.3â€¯GHz) but less common

Scientific/Commercial Bands
Licensed through ITU and national agencies

S-band (2â€“4â€¯GHz)

Common for higher-data downlink (e.g. 2.2â€“2.3â€¯GHz)

X-band (8â€“12â€¯GHz)

Used for high-rate payload data, remote sensing missions

Ka-band (26â€“40â€¯GHz)

Less common in CubeSats due to pointing and power constraints
